# react-native-todo

View the app demo on You-tube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_jXWZT1Krc&feature=youtu.be

Created a simple #reactnative to-do list application. Recorded the IOS emulator to show how the app works. I was extremely excited to play with and learn some react-native and I really enjoyed building this.

## What I got gained from this:
Continued practice building components
Continued practice with state
Learned how to build with react-native and the differences and similarities to react,
Learned how to work with react-native components

## Future:
Want to keep playing react-native and building more apps
Want to add the ability for users to edit already created to-dos
